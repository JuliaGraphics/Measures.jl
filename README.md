# Measures.jl

[![Build
Status](https://travis-ci.org/JuliaGraphics/Measures.jl.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/JuliaGraphics/Measures.jl)

This library generalizes and unifies the notion of measures used in
[Compose](https://github.com/GiovineItalia/Compose.jl),
[Compose3D](https://github.com/rohitvarkey/Compose3D.jl),
and [Escher](https://github.com/shashi/Escher.jl).

It allows building up and representing expressions involving differing types of
units that are then evaluated, resolving them into absolute units.
